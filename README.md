## Tips/Notes
Ask local people about local history! Don't let it get forgotten.

### Roadways
Look at all sorts of old gravel roads, logging roads, etc on maps or topoview. Each road has it's own story to tell! Many of these roads remain untouched in rural areas. Remember that towns still have history hiding in them, you'll just have to look a little bit. Also, many roads were very different 100 years ago, especially at creek crossings. Our tax dollars have gone a long way!

When building the interstate system, all sorts of small concrete tunnels were built to let wildlife and water flow through!

### Artifacts
Look for local historical things like fossils, arrowheads, etc that could be hiding in the ground. There may be tribes or animals that were on your land at one point that are no longer there. It's cool to see something someone made 100s of years ago though isn't it?

### Whitewashing
A lot of southern towns have swept up their history about slavery and don't talk about it in schools. Some local farms you pass by may have had slaves in them 100 years ago.

### Naming
Pay attention to any roads, creeks, hills, towns, that are named especially ones that people don't talk about, there could be underlying history about these names and you don't even know about it!
