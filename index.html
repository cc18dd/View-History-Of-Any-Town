    <h2>Other notes:</h2>
    <p>Look at all sorts of old gravel roads, logging roads, etc on maps or topoview. Each road has its own story to tell! Many of these roads remain untouched in rural areas. Remember that towns still have history hiding in them; you'll just have to look a little bit. Also, many roads were very different 100 years ago, especially at creek crossings. Our tax dollars have gone a long way!</p>
    <p>Also, look for local historical things like fossils, arrowheads, etc., that could be hiding in the ground. There may be tribes or animals that were on your land at one point that are no longer there. It's cool to see something someone made 100s of years ago though, isn't it?</p>
    <p>Sad notes: A lot of southern towns have swept up their history about slavery and don't talk about it in schools. Some local farms you pass by may have had slaves in them 100 years ago.</p>
