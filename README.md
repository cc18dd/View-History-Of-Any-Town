Other notes-
Look at all sorts of old gravel roads, logging roads, etc on maps or topoview. Each road has it's own story to tell! Many of these roads remain untouched in rural areas. Remember that towns still have history hiding in them, you'll just have to look a little bit. Also, many roads were very different 100 years ago, especially at creek crossings. Our tax dollars have gone a long way!
